## About

Take A Breath is a minimalist, full-stack web application built to spread kindness and positivity online. Inspired by the concept of a message in a bottle, it allows users to submit short, anonymous motivational quotes or kind messages. When someone visits the site, they receive a randomly selected note written by another user. The project is designed with accessibility and user experience in mind, offering a calm, focused space where people can pause, reflect, and feel supported—no accounts or logins needed. All messages are stored in a secure database and can be added or removed via a simple, user-friendly interface.
