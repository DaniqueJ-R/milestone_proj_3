## About

Take A Breath is a minimalist, full-stack web application built to spread kindness and positivity online. Inspired by the concept of a message in a bottle, it allows users to submit short, anonymous motivational quotes or kind messages. When someone visits the site, they receive a randomly selected note written by another user. The project is designed with accessibility and user experience in mind, offering a calm, focused space where people can pause, reflect, and feel supportedâ€”no accounts or logins needed. All messages are stored in a secure database and can be added or removed via a simple, user-friendly interface.

## User Experience

### Strategy

This site is aimed at overall internet users seeking comforting and motivational quotes, and in turn would like to contribute to the positive pile of affirmations. The primary goals are to:

- Anyone is able to view notes at any time on the site
- atmosphere of site is changeable to allow for a more calming experience
- Logged in users are able to add, edit, and delete their own notes

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to be notified if my message contains harmful language and be prevented from submitting it, so the platform stays safe and positive.
- As a user, I want to log in so that I can edit and delete my own notes, ensuring I stay in control of my content.
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to write and save a new note, so that I can express my thoughts and keep track of them.
- As a user, I want to click back and next buttons to flip through quotes so I can explore multiple uplifting messages at my own pace.
- As a user, I want to change the siteâ€™s theme to match calming environments (space, sea, forest, etc.) so I can choose the mood that helps me feel relaxed. 
- As a user, I want my quote to appear on a sticky note design so the messages feel personal, warm, and handwritten.
- As a user, I want the background white noise to match the theme I select, so the visuals and audio work together to create a relaxing atmosphere.
- As a user, I want new notes to stack on top of each other like real sticky notes, so the experience feels visually tactile and comforting.
- As a user, I want to include my name or have it show "Anonymous" if I leave it blank, so I can choose my level of visibility.
- As a user, I want to post a quote to a specific category whenever I want, so that I can share affirmations and organize them by mood.
- As a user, I want to filter messages by emotional categories like stress or grief, so I can read messages that match how I feel.
- As a user, I want to decorate my sticky note with cute stickers by dragging and dropping them, so I can add a personal, expressive touch.
- As a user, I want to like notes that resonate with me, so I can express appreciation and help highlight notes that others may also enjoy.

### Primary Strategic Aims

## Surface


### Visual Design

- Custom matching colourscheem for Sea (Blue Tones), Sunset(Orange-Purple Tones), Cosmic (purple Tones), and Forest(Green Tones)  or calming color palette
- Accessible typography for overall site
- Curved hadwritten typography for notes displayed
- Simple, welcoming layout

### Color Scheme

From the beginning, I wanted the site to feel dynamic and personal, so instead of being limited to a single color palette, I designed it to adapt based on the userâ€™s chosen theme. Users can select between **Ocean, Sunset, Forest, or Space/Cosmic**, each with its own unique gradient background, note card styling, and button colors while keeping accessibility and readability in mind.

To achieve this, I created theme-specific CSS classes (e.g., `.theme-sea`, `.theme-forest`, `.theme-sunset`, `.theme-space`) that apply consistent styling across the siteâ€™s elements, including the body background, note cards, and buttons. This ensures the design is cohesive within each theme while still providing variety and personalization.

Each theme was tested for **readability and accessibility**, with contrasting text colors against gradient backgrounds to ensure all notes remain easy to read for all visitors regardless of theme choice:

### ðŸŒŒ Space / Cosmic - 

Deep indigos and purples with soft lavender notes.

* Background: `linear-gradient(indigo, purple, black)`
* Note cards: `#d8b4fe â†’ #c4b5fd`
* Text color: `#3730a3`
* Buttons: `#a78bfa` (hover: `#7c3aed`)

### ðŸŒŠ Ocean-

Bright turquoise and blues for a refreshing, calm aesthetic.

* Background: `linear-gradient(#60a5fa, #06b6d4, #0d9488)`
* Note cards: `#67e8f9 â†’ #60a5fa`
* Text color: `#1e40af`
* Buttons: `#3b82f6` (hover: `#2563eb`)

### ðŸŒ² Forest -

Natural greens with dark accents for grounding and balance.

* Background: `linear-gradient(#065f46, #047857, #064e3b)`
* Note cards: `#bbf7d0 â†’ #34d399`
* Text color: `#065f46`
* Buttons: `#10b981` (hover: `#059669`)

### ðŸŒ… Sunset - 

Warm oranges, pinks, and purples for an uplifting atmosphere.

* Background: `linear-gradient(#fb923c, #ec4899, #7c3aed)`
* Note cards: `#fed7aa â†’ #f9a8d4`
* Text color: `#c2410c`
* Buttons: `#f97316` (hover: `#ea580c`)


### Media

**Logo**

Since no logo was provided for this project, I explored free design resources to find one that fit the calming and uplifting theme of the site. After reviewing several options, I selected a completed logo from Creative Fabrica
, which aligned perfectly with the projectâ€™s minimalist aesthetic and focus on positivity.

The logo was chosen for its professional design quality and its ability to reflect the projectâ€™s purposeâ€”creating a safe, welcoming space for users to pause, reflect, and share kindness. Its simple, modern style ensures accessibility and brand recognition across devices.

**Audio**

The video is also a mockup generated using the AI site Ai.invideo as a generated promotional video detailing more of Zenair Wellness Center's values and general goal for the members.

**Summery**
- All images and audio include alt tags
- Colour themes inspured by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- Audio embedded from sources like [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
- Logo sourced from free platform [Creative Fabrica](https://www.creativefabrica.com/product/take-a-deep-breath-retro-svg/)
