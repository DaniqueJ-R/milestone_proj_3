## üóÇÔ∏è PHASE 1: PLANNING

### Step 1: Define the Project
- [x] Write project description - 

Take A Breath is a simple, uplifting web application designed to brighten someone‚Äôs day‚Äîone message at a time. Inspired by the idea of a message in a bottle, the site allows users to anonymously write and share short motivational quotes or kind thoughts with the world. When someone visits the site, they receive a randomly selected message written by another user, offering a moment of encouragement, hope, or reflection. Take A Breath creates a quiet space on the internet where strangers can support one another through small but meaningful acts of kindness.

üñºÔ∏è Homepage Version (warm, inviting tone)
Welcome to Take A Breath üí¨
This is your quiet corner of the internet. Here, you‚Äôll find short, uplifting messages‚Äîwritten by strangers, just for you. Every time you visit, you‚Äôll receive a random note of encouragement or kindness, shared anonymously by someone who wanted to make someone else‚Äôs day a little better. You can also leave your own message to inspire someone else. Take a breath. You're not alone.


- [x] Identify core features (CRUD, auth, etc.)

‚úÖ Core Features of Take A Breath
üîπ 1. Create (C in CRUD)
Users can anonymously submit a motivational message or quote.

Each message is saved in a database with metadata (e.g., timestamp, optional nickname).

üîπ 2. Read
Visitors are shown a random message submitted by another user.

Users can refresh or revisit to receive a different uplifting message.

üîπ 3. Update
Optional: You can allow messages to be edited within a short time window or by admins only.

Not required for MVP, but helps fulfill full CRUD if needed.

üîπ 4. Delete
Optional: Add a way to delete inappropriate messages.

Could be:
- Admin-only delete
- A simple "flag for review" button
- Or delete via a secret token (if user gets one upon submission)

Auth - Or skip auth and do light moderation if you're not going public

üóÉÔ∏è Database Model (Example)
Field	Type	Description
id	Integer	Primary key
message	Text	The uplifting note content
author	String	Optional nickname (anonymous)
timestamp	DateTime	Stored when message is submitted
flagged	Boolean	For moderation (optional)

To enhance user experience and work toward distinction-level criteria, Take A Breath includes or aims to include the following thoughtful design features:

‚ú® Responsive Design: The site is fully mobile-friendly, adapting seamlessly across devices and screen sizes for an accessible and smooth experience.

‚ú® Input Validation: Users are guided by a clear character limit and live validation when writing their notes, helping keep messages concise and impactful.

‚ú® Submission Feedback: Upon submitting a message, users receive immediate visual feedback, such as a thank-you popup or animated confirmation, reinforcing their contribution to the community.

‚ú® Smooth Transitions: Soft animations or loading effects create a calm, seamless experience when retrieving or displaying new notes.

‚ú® Sticker Pop-Out: A creative, interactive sticker section is planned‚Äîusers will be able to click and drag stickers (e.g. hearts, stars, leaves) to the bottom of their note before submitting. This adds a playful and personal touch to their message.

‚ú® Ambiance Selector (Instead of Dark Mode): Rather than a standard dark/light toggle, users can choose from immersive ambiance themes like Space, Ocean, or Forest. Each theme changes the site's visual style and activates matching ambient soundscapes or white noise, helping set a calming mood.

‚ú® Accessibility-Focused: The design considers accessibility with high color contrast, keyboard-friendly navigation, semantic HTML, and alt text for all images and icons.
